Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For version 0.1
===============

* Defining (preliminary) structure for dataset
  
   * data: Raw FID or Fourier transformed data?
   * metadata: Which information exactly?
   * how to handle metadata?

* Create pseudo-processing steps that put all previously performed processing steps in the history.

* How to transfer information on the nucleus between analysis and processing step for external referencing? (Provided one can only pass the result which is a value.)

* Enable black for code style
