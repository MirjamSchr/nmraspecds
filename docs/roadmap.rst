Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For version 0.2
===============

* Create pseudo-processing steps that put all previously performed processing steps in the history.

* Normalization to number of scans: Possibility to provide scan number manually.

* Importing more/all parameters from the TopSpin files to the metadata.
