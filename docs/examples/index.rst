Overview
========

Here, we present a (growing) series of working examples of how to use the NMRAspecds package to perform both, day-to-day routine tasks and different plotting options in a laboratory working with NMR spectroscopy.

For each of the examples, a full recipe is provided ready to be copied and pasted and run on your local computer.

.. note::

    For each of the recipes provided so far, the NMRAspecds package (at least its `repository on GitHub <https://github.com/MirjamSchr/nmraspecds>`_) contains the real example data as well. Therefore, you can download the data and recipe to get first-hand experience with the NMRAspecds package.


Prerequisites
=============

To be able to run the example recipes locally, you need to have a working installation of the NMRAspecds package and its dependencies. Have a look at the :doc:`installation instructions <../installing>` for details.

Furthermore, to be able to run ("cook") the recipes and get ("serve") the results, you need to have access to a command line, as running recipes (still) is command-line based using the command :samp:`serve {recipe.yaml}`.

**Optional:** For some recipes, you will need to have a working LaTeX installation in case you would like to get your reports not only created, but compiled into a well-formatted PDF document as well.


.. note::

    The path to the data in the recipes assumes the directory layout of the NMRAspecds package. Hence, the easiest way is to clone or download the repository from `GitHub <https://github.com/MirjamSchr/nmraspecds>`_, change into the ``examples`` directory and there into the respective subdirectory and run the corresponding recipe.
